Hello, this project has been created for the Patika bootcamp. The purpose of the project is to enable a veterinary clinic to manage their own business. For instance, within the system, we can add entities such as veterinarians, pets, customers, and functionalities like the working days of veterinarians, appointments, vaccinations, etc., following the logic written in the service layer. For example, the system does not allow adding another vaccination with the code "X" to the same animal before the protective period of the previous "X" coded vaccination expires.
In the project, Spring Boot and PostgreSQL were used. If you want to see the dependencies used, you can check the pom.xml file.
Also If you want to run the project, after cloning it and opening it in your code editor, you need to right-click on the pom.xml file and select "Reload." Additionally, you will need a connection to a PostgreSQL database.

Here is the UML Class Diagram of the project:
